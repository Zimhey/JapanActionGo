Things to Do

Inu only follows once, then sits down, then doesn't follow again
Same thing with Nyudo, which also doesn't kill you if you leave it and come back
Oni gets stuck in Idle after moving just a little bit


Things I've Checked that Work

Inu chases things away
Nyudo taunts and kills
Oni kills when it does move
